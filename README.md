# CV-EminaT
I've tried to create a project to develop and publish my CV as a mobile web application  using SAP Cloud Platform as the deployment 
platform, HANA Database as the backend and UI5 as the frontend. I have decided to do so using SAP's Mobile Cards.

However, I have encountered some issues visualising the mobile card on the SAP Mobile Cards app for Android because the Query entity
Wrapper on the URLs tab was not configured correctly. I have tried different combinations but the problem persisted. Nevertheless, 
you can find in this repository the Odata project I edited and used in Web IDE as well as the folder containing the files where I edited
the front and back templates of the card.

You will also find in this repository a folder containing the files I used to successfully build a web app where I published my CV using
SAPUI5 as the frontend.
